				<h1>Dhyaan ध्यान</h1>
				<p class="lead">Born out of the observation that people are becoming more curious about how to build a purposeful life for themselves and the need for connection with others. We believe that there is power in bringing together people who share this goal for an unforgettable experience with the wish to build a longstanding community established by deep connections and fulfilling relationships. This practice of Dhyan is meant to provide an easy approach that anyone can perform at any given time.</p>

	  		<h2>What is Dhyaan?</h2>
	  			<div class="container">

						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
							<h3>Mindfullness</h3>
							<p>Dhyan is a meditation practice that connects the body, mind, and soul leading to the full awareness of the present moment and the self. When one becomes more mindful of oneself, the speed of thoughts decreases resulting in becoming more relaxed, balanced, and happier. Once it is practiced with consistency, a change is felt from within, the state of mind, breathing patterns, thought process, energy, and aura. With the changed self, one finds perfection in thoughts and actions. Naturally, the person will attract more positivity in their life, and will be able to manage the mind and how it deals with all types of situations, positive and negative..</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
							<h3>Mindful Breathing</h3>
							<p>Mindful Breathing in Dhyan is referred to as Pranayama which means “breath control”. It is a collection of breathing exercises, including fast and slow-paced breathing, which improve mental focus and healing. Having a stronger control of breath will help you become aware of the present moment and guide you to achieve a deeper connection with the body, mind, and world.
								These breathing techniques focused on respiratory resistance also expel impurities from the body. This purification boosts immunity, stabilizes the mind, and balances yourself.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
							<h3>Mindful Dance</h3>
							<p>Mindful Dance is a type of meditation in which we use rhythm, attentiveness, and an intuitive state which is both recreational and meditational. Dance is one of the paths to discovering a calm, quiet, place inside you that is filled with joy, wisdom, and love. When you do this dance meditation, you release a tremendous amount of tension, and creative insights arise. Tension is simply trapped energy. The wild and free movement of the dance is a great way to set this energy free. Feeling free allows your mind to expand, your heart to open, and your spirit to soar. This technique allows the dynamism of the dance to move to the very core of your being, liberating great feelings of joy and positivity.</p>
